## Book Exchange
Used HTML, CSS, PHP, SQL, and Bootstrap to create a responsive dynamic website. The website's objective is to allow users to register and exchange books with one another. Guest users can look at different books, but only registered users can see the details of other users who have enlisted the book and contact them to exchange their favorites.
